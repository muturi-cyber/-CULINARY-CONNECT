## PROJECT OVERVIEW

Food is essential to culture, and African cuisine is rich in diversity, flavors, and traditions. However,
discovering authentic African recipes tailored to personal preferences can be challenging, especially for
users unfamiliar with regional variations. This project aims to bridge that gap by developing an AI-powered
Recipe Recommendation System and Sentiment Analysis Model.

## BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING

---

### Business Objectives

1. The primary objective is to create a recipe Recommendation system, a Sentiment Analysis Model to enhance user satisfaction through personalized recipe suggestions and improved engagement across diverse culinary experiences. 

2. Improve decision-making with data-driven insights by identifying popular recipes and trends through sentimental analysis, understanding the pain points of customers eg ingredient availability, etc., and  optimizing recipe suggestions based on positive and negative feedback. 

3. Increasing revenue and platform growth by driving traffic to food blogs, e-commerce stores, and cooking classes. Boosting engagement for advertisers, chefs, and food businesses on the platform.


### Stakeholders

- **Platform Users:** Seek personalized and diverse recipe recommendations.
- **Developers & Data Science Team:** Responsible for model development and chatbot integration.
- **Business Analysts:** Utilize insights to identify popular trends and user preferences.


### EDA Integration
1. What are the most common ingredients used across all cuisines?
2. How does the nutritional content vary across different cuisines?
3. Which cuisines receive the most positive/negative feedback?

#### Correlation between different Nutrients


![image link](https://github.com/muturi-cyber/Recipe-Intelligence-/blob/main/corr%20btn%20diff%20nutrients.png)


Fat content is a strong predictor of calorie count.
 
High-fat foods typically contain more saturated fat and fatty acids.

Sodium-rich foods tend to have less potassium which may impact dietary balance.

## MODELING

### 1. RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM

Objective:
 
Provide personalized recipe suggestions to users based on preference, past interactions or similarities.
 
Modeling Techniques used:
 
Content-Based Filtering:
It utilizes TF-IDF or cosine similarity to recommend recipes based on ingredient overlap.
 
Collaborative Filtering:
Leverages user-item interaction matrix for personalized suggestions.
 
Evaluation Metrics:

Content-Based Model Results:
MSE: 0.1214
RMSE: 0.3484

The model shows low prediction error, indicating good accuracy.

Predictions deviate by ~0.35 units on average.

Content-based filtering performs well for personalized recipe recommendations

### 2. SENTIMENTAL ANALYSIS MODEL

Objective: 
Classify user reviews into positive, neutral or negative sentiments, to understand user preferences and improve engagement
 
Modeling Techniques Used: 
Data Preprocessing: 
Cleaning text data by removing stopwords, punctuation, and special characters.
Tokenization and vectorization using TF-IDF or Word Embeddings for feature extraction.

Model Selection and Training:  
Logistic Regression: Itâ€™s used to predict the sentiment category.

Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy - 96 %

### How Recommendation and sentiment analysis work together.

recommendation System - suggests recipes based on calories, ingredients and cooking time.
Sentiments Analysis - Analyzes user reviews to understand satisfaction and improve recommendations.

Feedback Loop :

- Positive reviews - Boosts recipe ranking.
- Negative reviews - Lower ranking or adjustment
- Continuous Improvement - enhances user satisfaction and engagement

---

## CONCLUSION

The Sentiment Analysis Model provides valuable insights into customer opinions, allowing businesses to improve their offerings. However,
refining text cleaning and model tuning can improve accuracy.

The Recommendation System successfully suggests recipes but can be enhanced with personalized filtering and user feedback loops.

Implementing these models in a real-world food app can boost user engagement, improve satisfaction, and increase retention rates.

## RECOMMENDATION

### Marketing Focus

Promote highly rated and calorie-dense recipes to attract food enthusiasts.

Highlight these recipes in advertisements, social media, and promotional campaigns.

### User Insights & Review Analysis

Analyze negative reviews across different rating ranges to identify recurring issues.

Focus on reviews from 2013-2018 to detect significant shifts in sentiment and trends.

### Health-Conscious Options

Introduce low-calorie and nutrient-rich alternatives to cater to health-conscious consumers.
